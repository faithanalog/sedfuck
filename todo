comment the code to explain what's going on
explain the clearBranchCache macro
maybe a version that could plausibly have been hand-written
    less inlining
consider hex format for numbers instead of binary for less text transactions
more efficienct use of the hold space

clustering
pipe seds into eachother and make them be microservices


Notes from sed source code:
Sed will grow its text buffer dynamically, and will shrink it too
It shrinks if the pattern size is < 33% of the buffer size

# TODO store output buffer in hex until we're ready to actually print it, otherwise < and > break

it might be smart to accept hex or base64 input and print hex or base64 output. that gives us access to the null byte on our input and output too, and then we just have to wrap our sed execution with an encoder and decoder

we could also make something which actually compiles brainfuck to sed
