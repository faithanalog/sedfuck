clean up a lot of unnecssary character classes for math (can just use . since we dont typecheck anyway)
make a version that only has the necessary functions, move the others elsewhere for future use
comment the code to explain what's going on
figure out how to make the m4 output nicer
figure out how to implement reading user input
explain the clearBranchCache macro
maybe a version that could plausibly have been hand-written
    less inlining
consider hex format for numbers instead of binary for less text transactions
more efficienct use of the hold space

clustering
pipe seds into eachother and make them be microservices


Notes from sed source code:
Sed will grow its text buffer dynamically, and will shrink it too
It shrinks if the pattern size is < 33% of the buffer size

# TODO store output buffer in hex until we're ready to actually print it, otherwise < and > break
